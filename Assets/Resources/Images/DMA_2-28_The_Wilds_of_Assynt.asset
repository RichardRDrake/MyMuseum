  ArtefactContent: Cameron, David Young, oil on canvas, 1936. Cameron was a 20th
    century romantic, who made some of the most majestic paintings of the Scottish
    landscape ever executed. This almost square canvas was his own personal favourite
    and he considered it his masterpiece. He has captured perfectly the range and
    tone of a sunny Scottish autumn day. The painting was purchased from the artist
    in 1936 to grace the walls of the then newly opened Perth Art Gallery and Museum.
    Cameron instructed his agent to hang the painting against a backdrop of red cloth
    to bring out the strength and contrast of the rich colouring of the work.
