  ArtefactContent: "Ramsay, David Prophet, oil on canvas, 1924.  Born in Perth to
    a local china merchant, Ramsay was educated at Perth Academy before studying
    carpet design with Coates Bros. in Dunkeld Road, Perth. He enrolled at Glasgow
    School of Art where he won the Haldane Prize, using the \xA350 award to travel
    and paint around Europe. During the First World War Ramsay joined the 4th Battalion
    Black Watch, seeing action on the Western Front near Ypres in Belgium. In 1917
    he was seriously wounded in the left lung by a shell. After the war, Ramsay set
    up his studio in Charlotte Street, Perth swiftly becoming a nationally renowned
    portraitist and figure-painter. He was fascinated by the effect of artificial
    light on his subjects and was celebrated for his sense of colour."
