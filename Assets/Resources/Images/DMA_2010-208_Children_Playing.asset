  ArtefactContent: "Eardley, Kathleen Joan, 1955. Oil on canvas, Eardley was born
    in Sussex in 1921. She moved to Scotland with her family in 1939 and they settled
    in the Glasgow suburb of Bearsden the following year. At the same time, Eardley
    began studying at Glasgow School of Art, where she was taught by Hugh Adam Crawford.
    Eardley went on to study at Hospitalfield House's postgraduate art school under
    James Cowie, who helped shape her preference for everyday subjects. In 1948 Eardley
    completed a post diploma year at Glasgow School of Art. After travels in Italy
    and France, she moved to Glasgow where she drew and painted the local street
    children of Townhead. These works capture the last traces of a poverty stricken
    area of one of Scotland\u2019s major cities. In 1954, while still living in Glasgow,
    she spent much time in Catterline before moving there permanently in 1961. She
    died in 1963 at the age of just 42."
