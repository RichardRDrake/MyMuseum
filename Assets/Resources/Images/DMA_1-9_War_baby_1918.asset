  ArtefactContent: "Blyth, Robert Henderson, oil on board, 1945. Through directly
    related to the Second World War, Blythe\u2019s painting reaches across chronological
    barriers and makes a more universal and timeless statement. The subject is a
    pathetic and clearly shocked British soldier on the German border.  He is obviously
    wounded, a huge iodine soaked bandage covers a bloody wound to his left ear. 
    He is waiting to be evacuated back home. As the title implies, this particular
    individual was born as the First World War drew to its end in 1918.  Ironically,
    fresh-faced and with the open haunting eyes of innocence, he finds himself caught
    up in an equally horrific war.  The soldier himself has become the evacuee, a
    fate to which countless thousands of civilians were subjected as a direct result
    of the Second World War."
