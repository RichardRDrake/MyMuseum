  ArtefactName: Fossil Fish Head-shield, Type Specimen
  ArtefactContent: This is an incomplete head-shield of a fossil fish found in old
    red sandstone rocks at the Wolf's Hole quarry near Bridge of Allan. These early
    armour-headed fish swam in the Devonian seas around 390 million years ago. This
    specimen is an example of a type specimen on which scientific names are based.
    The specimen was collected by the Victorian geologist, Reverend Hugh Mitchell
    (1822-1894), and gifted to the Perthshire Society of Natural Science. In 1963
    the fossil was examined by fossil fish expert, Dr Errol White of the British
    Museum (Natural History). He realised this fossil was new to science and gave
    it the scientific name Securiapis caledonica.
