  ArtefactName: The Bellany Family
  ArtefactContent: "Bellany, John, oil on hardboard, 1968. Set in his studio, Bellany
    presents himself as a hard-drinking man with his arm around his pregnant wife,
    Helen. Their son Jonathan sits in a model boat perhaps with a nod to his own
    childhood spent drawing in his father\u2019s workshop while his father made model
    boats. Jonathan\u2019s golliwog lays discarded as if it is something he has outgrown.
    Behind and to the right are paintings that Bellany has recently completed: part
    of a painting of windswept fisherman with a bible tossed in front of it on the
    floor \u2013 the fishing industry and religion, central themes throughout Bellany\u2019s
    career and Buchenwald prisoners in their striped uniforms representing a darker
    period in the artist\u2019s life after visiting the camp with his friends the
    poet, Alan Bold and artist, Alexander Moffat."
