  ArtefactContent: "McTaggart, William, oil on canvas, 1903. William McTaggart was
    born in Aros in Kintyre in 1835. He moved to Edinburgh at the age of only 16
    and studied at the Trustees' Academy under Robert Scott Lauder. He won several
    prizes as a student and exhibited his work in the Royal Scottish Academy. While
    his early works were mainly figure paintings, inspired by his childhood love
    of the sea, he later turned seascape painting. From the 1880s, he painted the
    majority of his works outdoors, en plein air. While his work has been compared
    to the French Impressionists, he was influenced by Constable. Today he is recognised
    as one of Scotland\u2019s best landscape painters. "
