  ArtefactContent: Fergusson, John Duncan, oil on canvas, 1910. The dramatic entry
    of the nude in Fergusson's work took the form of a group of monumental paintings
    executed between 1910 and 1912. This is one of the first of them. His decision
    to tackle the subject was probably inspired by Fauve examples such as Matisse's
    'Blue Nude' and Derain's 'Three Bathers' both 1907.
