  ArtefactContent: "Byrne, John, oil on canvas, 1968. Byrne was born in Paisley and
    studied at Glasgow School of Art.  During his time at GSA, Byrne was awarded
    a number of scholarships, bursaries and medals where he was and still is, regarded
    as one of the most technically brilliant artists to have attended that prestigious
    institution. Byrne went on to become a successful television and theatre writer
    and stage designer. In the 1960s and 1970s he produced a number of naive paintings
    influenced by Douanier Rousseau, which he signed \u201CPatrick\u201D. This is
    a powerful example of Byrne\u2019s \u201CPatrick\u201D style. The artworks have
    become recognisable symbols of the pop music of the day, particularly his portrait
    of the Beatles."
