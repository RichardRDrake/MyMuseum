  ArtefactName: St Madoes cross-slab, Pictish
  ArtefactContent: 'Sandstone, 8/9 century. Impressive Pictish cross slab carved
    on the two broad faces. The principal face is filled with a wheel-headed cross.
    The crosshead arms have expanding terminals and hollow sockets. The crosshead
    junction is overlain by a square panel contianing swirling relief bosses. the
    shaft and arms are filled with interlace and key patterns. Running up thye side
    of the shaft are two pairs of dogs, the second biting the rear of the first in
    each pair. Lying diagonally across the upper curves of the cross wheel are two
    lions., the heads turned back. these are matched by pair of lions across the
    upper, narrow edge of the slab. Damage to this are has removed the head of on
    eof these lions. Between the heads appears to ahve been a space where something
    could be added to the cross, perhaps a relic, on special feast days. The opposite
    face has been damged by water runn-off, partially removing element sof the symbols
    carved on lower portion. At the bottom is the so-called Pictish beast with a
    crescent and V-rod and a double-disc immediately above. Above the symbols is
    a verticla arnagment of three rectangular panels, within each one a horse and
    hooded rider.  One of these is clearly carrying a satchel. They probably represent
    ecclesiastics. st Madoes is on the road betwen three powerful royal-church communities:
    Scone, Abernethy and St Andrews.'
