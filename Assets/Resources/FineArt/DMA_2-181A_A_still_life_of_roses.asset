  ArtefactContent: Peploe, Samuel John, oil on canvas, 1931. Samuel John Peploe is
    now known as one of the Scottish Colourists, along with John Duncan Fergusson,
    George Leslie Hunter and Francis Campbell Boileau Cadell. Like Fergusson he was
    from Edinburgh, and it was there that they met and became good friends, around
    1900. More crucially, they spent a lot of time together in Paris at the advent
    of the developments of modern art. In later years, Peploe set out to create the
    perfect still-life and he tacked the subject over and over again as his many
    paintings in this genre testify.
