  ArtefactName: Portrait of Effie Millais (nee Gray)
  ArtefactContent: "Millais, John Everett, oil on canvas, 1873. Millais\u2019 association
    with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood brought him in contact with the art critic
    and author, John Ruskin.  Ruskin was married to Euphemia Chalmers Gray.  In 1854
    the marriage was annulled and in 1855 she and Millais were married in her family
    home, Bowerswell House, in Perth.  This episode caused one of the greatest scandals
    of the Victorian period. Effie was 45 when Millais began this portrait of her. 
    In her lap is a copy of the Cornhill magazine, with harvesting scenes on the
    cover.  Effie is pointing to a thresher.  This may be an in-joke between husband
    and wife, as Effie managed Millais\u2019 work and often pushed him to complete
    commissions and accept new ones."
