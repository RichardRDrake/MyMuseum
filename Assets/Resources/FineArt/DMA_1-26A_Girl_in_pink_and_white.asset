  ArtefactContent: "Cadell, Francis Campbell Boileau, oil on canvas, 1911. As the
    youngest in the group of painters now known collectively as the Scottish Colourists,
    it was not until around the time of this painting that Cadell really established
    his career. By then, John Duncan Fergusson and Samuel John Peploe were exhibiting
    in Paris and London. Cadell studied in Paris and lived in Munich before settling
    in his native Edinburgh around 1909. A visit to Venice in 1910 was crucial in
    freeing Cadell\u2019s technique. It inspired him to paint in the loose, fluid
    manner of this work. He is perhaps the most sophisticated of the Colourists and
    is celebrated for his elegant depictions of Edinburgh New Town interiors and
    his brightly coloured and simplified still lifes."
