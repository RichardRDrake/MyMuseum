  ArtefactContent: Redpath, Anne, oil on board, 1959. Redpath was born in Galashiels.
    She studied concurrently at Moray House College of Education and at Edinburgh
    College of Art. Travel scholarships allowed her to work in London, the Netherlands,
    France and Italy. After a lengthy spell in France, Redpath returned to Hawick
    in the mid-1930s with her three sons, while her husband took a job in London.
    She quickly re-established herself as a promising artist. In 1949 she moved to
    Edinburgh, becoming a pivotal figure in the group of painters now referred to
    as the Edinburgh School. Although perhaps best known for her interior still lifes,
    in her later years she painted many hillsides, as she continued to travel. In
    these works she often favoured a limited palette, such as in this painting.
