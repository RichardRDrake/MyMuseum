  ArtefactName: Loch Katrine, Horatio McCulloch
  ArtefactContent: "McCulloch, Horatio, oil on canvas, 1866. Ground-breaking at the
    time, Horatio McCulloch\u2019s Highland landscapes were romantic, wild and dramatic.
    As with Landseer, McCulloch was heavily inspired by Sir Walter Scott and this
    painting was based on the writer\u2019s poem of 1810, \u2018The Lady of the Lake\u2019.
    Scott\u2019s literary works and his interest in places steeped in Scottish history
    resonated with a burgeoning sense of national and cultural identity."
