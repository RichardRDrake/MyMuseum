  ArtefactContent: Crosbie, William, oil on canvas, 1939. Crosbie was born in Hankow,
    China, of Scottish parents. The family returned to Scotland in 1926. He entered
    Glasgow School of Art in 1932, graduating in 1935. He was awarded a travel scholarship
    and went to Paris, where he studied under Fernand Leger. He returned to Glasgow
    in 1939 where he set up a studio. During the War, he served in the Merchant Navy,
    though he continued to paint. During his years spent working as an artist, Crosbie
    experimented in a variety of styles. La Vie Distraite illustrates the fact that
    Scottish artists were aware of contemporary European movements and were sympathetic
    to them.  The painting contains Cubist elements, but is more overtly Surrealist
    in its approach.  The social comment of the work reflects the state of flux and
    confusion during the troubled year of 1939.
