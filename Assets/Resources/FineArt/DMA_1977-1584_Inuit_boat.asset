  ArtefactName: Inuit boat
  ArtefactContent: Model oomiak or canoe. The sails are made of caribou skin and
    the canoe is covered in walrus hide. The pully and sail rings are from sections
    of walrus tusk. There are seven passengers; six dressed in rabbit fur and one
    in sealskin. The model contains a harpoon of ivory and wood, as well as three
    paddles. The 'umiak' is a type of large boat used for whale hunting and for transporting
    families from one hunting location to another. Often women were in charge of
    such boats.
