  ArtefactContent: "Hunter, George Leslie, oil on canvas. Hunter, like Fergusson,
    undertook no official artistic training. Born in Rothesay, Hunter\u2019s family
    emigrated to California in 1892. His painting interests were fuelled by trips
    to Scotland and France around 1904 to 1905. He responded more slowly than Fergusson
    to the radical artistic developments then centred in Paris. It was not until
    the 1920\u2019s that he adopted a brighter palette and more fluid handling of
    paint, the initial stages of which can be seen in this painting. "
