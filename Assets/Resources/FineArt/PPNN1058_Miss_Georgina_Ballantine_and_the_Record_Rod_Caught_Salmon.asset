  ArtefactName: Miss Georgina Ballantine and the Record Rod Caught Salmon
  ArtefactContent: Raeburn Photographic Studio, Perth, silver gelatin print, c. 1922.
    On 7th October 1922, Georgina Ballantine entered the record books. Fishing from
    a boat on the Glendelvine stretch of the River Tay in Perthshire she cast her
    spinning tackle into the water. She hooked a large and powerful salmon and her
    angling skills were tested in the two hours that it took to land the fish. The
    salmon weighed 64 pounds. To this day her salmon still stands as the British
    rod-caught record for the species, as well as being the largest freshwater fish
    ever landed by an angler in the British Isles. This photograph of Miss Ballantine
    and her record breaking fish was taken at the Raeburn Photographic Studio in
    Perth a few days after the capture.
