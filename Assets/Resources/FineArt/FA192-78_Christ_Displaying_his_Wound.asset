  ArtefactName: Christ Displaying his Wounds
  ArtefactContent: Galli, Giovanni Antonio (Lo Spadarino), Oil on canvas, c. 1620.
    Three quarter length image of Christ; graphic chiaroscuro in typical style of
    the Caravaggisti. The painting was gifted to the Perth Literary and Antiquarian
    Society in 1861 by a local gentleman, William Macdonald of St Martins. Ruskin
    is said to have disapproved of the painting's style and execution.The identity
    of the artist has still to be established though it is probably the work of an
    Italian rather than a Spanish artist. The painting is exceptional for the quality
    of the treatment of the drapery and for the particular viewpoint which the artist
    has adopted, involving the viewer directly with the risen Christ.
