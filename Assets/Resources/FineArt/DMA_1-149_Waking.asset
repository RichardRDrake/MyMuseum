  ArtefactContent: Millais, John Everett, oil on canvas, c. 1876. Born in Southampton,
    Millais studied at the Royal Academy Schools in London. He became associated
    with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. So his work came to the attention of their
    early champion John Ruskin, the most influential art critic in England.  The
    picture is one of a pair, the other is titled Asleep. The title of this one may
    suggest a wider wakening as the girl grows up, hence the discarded books and
    toys of childhood, above all, the open doored, empty birdcage above her head
    at which she gazes. The picture is highly detailed in its technique.
