  ArtefactName: The sleeping princess
  ArtefactContent: Duncan, John, Tempera on canvas. This painting of The Sleeping
    Princess is by John Duncan, a Dundee artist who became a leading figure of the
    Celtic revivalist movement in Scotland. His early style was established with
    paintings based on Arthurian legend and later he created a series of paintings
    of Celtic myths and legends. He painted with the medium of tempera (a type of
    oil paint) in order to gain a precise density of colour and smoothness of surface
    that in time came to characterise his work.
