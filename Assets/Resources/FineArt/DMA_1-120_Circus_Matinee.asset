  ArtefactContent: Knight, Laura, oil on canvas, c.1935. Born Laura Johnson in Derbyshire
    in 1877, Dame Laura grew up in an artistic family and took art lessons from her
    mother.  She later went on to study at Nottingham College of Art, where she met
    her future husband, the painter Harold Knight. Although she painted an array
    of subjects, her reputation was founded on paintings of the ballet and circus. 
    In 1929, she was created a Dame and in 1936, she became the first ever woman
    elected to the Royal Academy.
