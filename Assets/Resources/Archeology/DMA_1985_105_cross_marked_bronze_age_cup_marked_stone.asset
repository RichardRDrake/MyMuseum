  ArtefactContent: 'A roughly triangular-shaped, boulder-like stone with an asymetrically
    scalloped upper edge. One face is carved with at least 12 cup and 1 ring markings,
    suggesting a Bronze Age origin.  The other side has been carved with aplain,
    space-filling Latin cross. It was reported to have been found on the hill Meal
    Rawer on the lower slopes of which are the hill farms Shenavail and Tominteold,
    where it had also been kept for a while. the are is arich Bronze Age landscape
    where several cup marked stones and hut circles can still be seen. Close by at
    Aird a Bronze Age dirk was also found. When the cup-marked stone was re-fashioned
    to serve as a cross-slab it was to help define the boundaries of the monastery
    at Dull just 3 miles further up the valley (and where the Becli slab was found). '
