  ArtefactName: 'New Scone cross-slab, Pictish                      '
  ArtefactContent: 'Incomplete cross-slab decorated on both broad faces with a long-shafted
    cross, each with a differing style of cross-head. The rest of each panel is decorated
    with key-patterns. The nearest comparitors for this style of decoration is St
    Andrews, which at that time was one of the key churches of the kingdom. When
    it came to light it was in a garden in New Scone but this is unlikely to be its
    original place. Circumstantial evidence suggests it may have origianlly come
    from Perth, presumably associated with an early church there. It is possible
    that it also came from Scone Abbey - a very importnat church and royal centre
    in the tenth century. Its church links with St Andrews might suggest a St Andrew''s
    carver did the work. '
