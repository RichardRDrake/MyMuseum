  ArtefactContent: 'This magnificent piece of early medieval sculpture, the Pictish
    St Madoes cross-slab, dates to the eighth century AD. Its imagery powerfully
    symbolises the authority of the Christian church. The whole is dominated by the
    ring-headed cross that fills what we can accept as the front of the slab. It
    is surrounded by biting dogs and with two lion-like creatures facing each other
    across the top of the stone. The back of the slab shows three cloaked and hooded
    riders, probably churchmen (possibly a reference to the road and its users between
    St Andrews and Scone) and below them three Pictish symbols: a crescent and v-rod,
    a double-disc and z-rod and a Pictish beast/elephant. The symbols are much worn
    due to exposure to the elements when it stood in St Madoes churchyard. In 1991
    the stone was conserved and moved to Perth Museum & Art Gallery.'
