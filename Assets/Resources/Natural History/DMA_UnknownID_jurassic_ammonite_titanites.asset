  ArtefactContent: This is a small example of a large ammonite found in Jurassic
    limestone at Portland, Dorset, England. They could grow up to 1.5 metres in diameter
    so perhaps this is a juvenile or incomplete specimen.  Ammonites were cephalopod
    molluscs distantly related to modern day squid and nautilus. They were active
    swimmers and predators of open water and lived in the tropical coral reef seas
    of the Jurassic alongside fish and sea reptiles.
