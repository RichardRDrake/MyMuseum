  ArtefactContent: "Part of the claw of an extinct Eurypterid, or water scorpion.
    The fossil was found at Tealing, Angus, Scotland, preserved in Lower Old Red
    Sandstone rock.  This Eurypterid was a fierce hunter in freshwater. The fossil
    is preserved in rocks that were once silty sand accumulating at the bottom of
    a large lake known as \u2018Lake Forfar\u2019 about 380 million years ago. In
    this lake lived small predatory fish and water scorpions."
