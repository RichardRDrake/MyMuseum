  ArtefactContent: At Dura Den in Fife, remarkable fossil fish were discovered during
    the nineteenth century. Called Holoptychius, these lobe-finned fish lived in
    freshwater lakes during the Devonian, 390 to 450 million years ago. The fish
    is thought to have been an ambush predator which lay in wait for passing smaller
    fish. The large numbers found suggest that they died as the result of a shallow
    lake drying up during a drought.  This specimen was collected during scientific
    excavations of Dura Den by the British Association for the Advancement of Science
    between 1912 and 1914.
