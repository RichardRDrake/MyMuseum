  ArtefactContent: This fossilised footprint was made by a theropod dinosaur about
    200 million years ago. It is preserved in Jurassic age rocks from North America.
    The theropods were large two-legged carnivores. Its scientific name, Eubrontes
    means "true thunder". The specimen was brought to Scotland by Captain Anderson
    and donated to the Marshall Museum, Kinross. This museum closed in 1996. The
    specimen was collected in the Connecticut River Valley in 1860. The Connecticut
    Valley is a world famous site for dinosaur tracks. Fossil footprints were first
    discovered there in the early nineteenth century. When first discovered these
    fossils were thought to be the footprints of giant birds. This specimen is in
    the collection of Perth Museum and Art Gallery.
