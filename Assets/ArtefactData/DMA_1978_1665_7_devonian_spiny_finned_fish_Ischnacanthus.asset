  ArtefactContent: "This fossil fish called Ischnacanthus gracilis was first discovered
    at Turin Hill near Forfar, Scotland by the Reverend Hugh Mitchell (1822-1894).
    Mitchell was the minister at Craig Free Church near Montrose. During the mid
    to late nineteenth century the sandstones of Strathmore were being actively quarried
    and Mitchell was able to build up an important collection of fish fossils.  The
    fossil is preserved in Lower Old Red Sandstone rock. These rocks were once silty
    sand accumulating at the bottom of a large lake known as \u2018Lake Forfar\u2019
    about 380 million years ago. In this lake lived small predatory fish and water
    scorpions."
