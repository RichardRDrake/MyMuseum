  ArtefactName: DMA_2151_Perth-Mirror-Case_Description
  ArtefactContent: A single, openwork, valve of a pewter mirror-case of the 13th
    century. It is oval in shape and retains traces of the putty used to hold its
    glass mirror (long perished) in place. It was found in 1921, during construction
    work on the corner of St Johns Place and King Edward Street. It was found crumpled
    up, implying it had been deliberately disposed of. The imagery depicts elements
    of the highly popular medieval romance of Tristram and Iseult, focussing upon
    the episode of the lovers tryst beneath the tree. King Mark, Tristram and Iseult
    are named across the middle portions of the mirror-case and the circumference
    carries an inscription in garbled, illiterate Anglo-Norman, wishing joy to the
    bearer of the mirror-case. As a mass-produced, cheap piece of jewellery, it significantly
    demonstrates the widespread and popular appeal of romance culture. Only two other
    examples of pewter, Tristram and Iseult mirror-cases are known, one from London,
    England and the other from Regensburg, Germany.
