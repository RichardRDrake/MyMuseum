  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  ArtefactName: DMA_1977-1868_Moa-Skeleton
  ArtefactContent: The tallest birds that ever lived were the moas from New Zealand.
    Some grew to three metres, about the height of a set of traffic lights. There
    may have been as many as 13 species of Moa judging from skeletal remains which
    have been discovered on both North and South Islands of New Zealand. They flourished
    on an island which had no mammals. The Moas demonstrate that persecution of animals
    is not a modern problem. Polynesian settlers arrived in New Zealand one thousand
    years ago. They introduced domestic mammals and hunted moas for meat. They made
    spear points, hooks and ornaments from moa bones and used moa eggs as water carriers.
    The moas declined and died out before 1775. This moa skeleton is from Ben More
    on the South Island of New Zealand. It was donated to the Perthshire Natural
    History Museum in 1888. This specimen is in the collection of Perth Museum and
    Art Gallery.
