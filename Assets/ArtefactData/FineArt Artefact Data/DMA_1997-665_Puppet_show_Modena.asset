  ArtefactContent: 'Colquhoun, Robert, Oil on canvas, 1951. Colquhoun was born in
    Kilmarnock, Ayrshire. He met Robert MacBryde at Glasgow School of Art. The pair
    became inextricably linked, garnering the name ''the Two Roberts''. A number
    of travelling scholarships allowed them to study in Italy and France. After a
    stint in the Royal Army Medical Corps in Edinburgh, he was invalided out and
    the Roberts moved to London, where they became associated with the neo-Romantic
    movement. Their experience of avant-garde French art meant their work was also
    inspired by Picasso, Braque and Wyndham Lewis. In 1943 the Polish artist Jankel
    Adler took a studio in their building and encouraged Colquhoun to paint from
    imagination and experience as opposed to from a model. His work became more austere,
    concentrating on the theme of the isolated, agonised figure. '
