  ArtefactContent: Philipson, Robin, Oil on canvas, 1968. Philipson was born in Cumbria
    in 1916. Soon after graduating, he was conscripted into the King's Own Scottish
    Borderers and served in India, Burma and Singapore. In 1947, he joined the staff
    at Edinburgh College of Art, where he remained until he retired in 1982. Alongside
    William Gillies, John Maxwell, William MacTaggart and Anne Redpath, Philipson
    was amongst the most prominent and expressionist members of the so-called Edinburgh
    School. Philipson often engaged in certain themes over a number of years and
    Mexican altars became a favoured subject matter.
