  ArtefactContent: Blackadder, Elizabeth, 1979. Watercolour, Blackadder was born
    in Falkirk and studied fine art at Edinburgh University, where her teachers included
    Robin Philipson, William MacTaggart and William Gillies, who had the biggest
    influence on her work. From the 1970s, her love of flowers played a prominent
    part in her work. She has travelled widely, absorbing influences from her time
    spent abroad. The motifs on display in this work are characteristic of some of
    her other still lifes. She is the first woman to be elected to both the Royal
    Academy and the Royal Scottish Academy.
