  ArtefactContent: This is an example of a glass model of a sea creature which was
    made for natural history museums all over the world by the Blaschkas. Leopold
    (1822-1895) and Rudolph (1857-1939), his son, had a workshop in Dresden, Germany
    which operated from the 1870's to 1930's. The set of models was bought from the
    Blaschkas by the Perthshire Natural History Museum in the 1880s.
