  ArtefactName: Christmas time in the South of France
  ArtefactContent: Fergusson, John Duncan, Oil on canvas, 1922. During renovations
    Fergusson and Morris were invited to spend Christmas with Davison in nearby Juan-les-Pins.
    'Our room opened onto the garden with palm trees and the beach beyond and the
    sound of the sea...Christmas dinner was on the terrace in the blazing sun'. The
    painting is a record of this memorable visit.
