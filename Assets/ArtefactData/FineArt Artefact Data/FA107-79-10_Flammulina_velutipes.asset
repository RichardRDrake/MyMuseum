  ArtefactContent: ' Potter, Beatrix, Watercolour, 1892. The Potters visited Perthshire
    on holiday every summer between 1871 and 1881, leasing Dalguise House on the
    banks of the River Tay just north of Dunkeld. During this time they met Charlie
    McIntosh the local postman, and a keen naturalist. In 1892 and 1893 the Potters
    returned and in 1892 Beatrix and Charlie met to discuss fungi. The earliest letter
    from Potter to Charlie McIntosh makes reference to this specimen which McIntosh
    had sent Potter by post. Potter had kept it in a tin and was amazed to discover
    "another fungus" growing on the branch, like a hundred fingers. In fact this
    is how the velvet shank grows in the dark.'
