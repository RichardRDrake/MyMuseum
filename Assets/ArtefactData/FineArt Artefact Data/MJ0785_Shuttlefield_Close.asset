    glass plate negative, 1877. This view shows partially demolished buildings in
    Shuttlefield Close, Perth in the 1880's.  Men, women and children stand among
    the ruins; two women are among the group standing between the roof timbers. 
    As the name suggests, weavers lived in this area of Perth. Shuttlefield Close,
    Perth, was demolished to make way for the building of Scott Street in 1877. 
    Perth, like other cities, had slum areas.  In 1895-6 200 properties were demolished
    or closed as unfit for human habitation.
