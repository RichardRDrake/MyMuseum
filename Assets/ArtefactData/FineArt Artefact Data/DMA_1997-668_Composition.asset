  ArtefactContent: Gear, William, Oil and gouache on card, 1949. Gear was born in
    Methil, Fife, and attended Edinburgh College of Art. Between 1937 and 1938 he
    studied for a brief time under Fernand Leger in Paris, though the War interrupted
    this experience. From 1947-1950 he lived in Paris and became affiliated to the
    COBRA movement, an informal grouping of artists from the northern countries.
    Their work became known for its spontaneous, rebellious style, influenced by
    Primitivism and the work of children. His works, such as this, of the late 1940s
    and early 1950s are marked by direct handling and jagged drawing. Although seemingly
    abstract, there are hints in them of the shapes of trees and other forms of nature.
