  ArtefactContent: This elk antler was excavated near Methven Castle, Perthshire,
    Scotland in the summer of 1801. It was discovered at a depth of seven and a half
    feet below the surface in a marl clay pit. At first it was put on display in
    Methven Castle until it was given to Perth Museum & Art Gallery in 1922.  Fossil
    remains such as this from the last ice age are the evidence for elk formerly
    living in Britain. They died out due to hunting and climate change. Today elk
    are found in the coniferous forests of Northern continental Europe and North
    America.
