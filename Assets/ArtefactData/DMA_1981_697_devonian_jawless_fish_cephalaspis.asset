  ArtefactName: DMA_1981_697_devonian_jawless_fish_cephalaspis
  ArtefactContent: This is the head shield of an early Cephalaspid or armour-headed
    fish. The specimen was collected at Balruddery in June 1895 on an excursion organised
    by the Perthshire Society of Natural Science.  Balruddery Den, a wooded ravine
    to the west of Dundee, Scotland was nationally famous amongst geologists in the
    nineteenth century for its fossil fish. Exposed in the Den are sandstones and
    shales deposited during the Devonian age, between 360 and 410 million years ago.
