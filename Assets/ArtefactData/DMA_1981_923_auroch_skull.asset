  ArtefactContent: This is the skull of an aurochs, or wild ox, the wild ancestor
    of modern domestic cattle. Destruction of forests and hunting over thousands
    of years led to its extinction. The species survived in Britain until the Bronze
    Age and the last wild aurochs was killed in Poland in 1627.  Chapleton Moss,
    five miles east of Forfar, Angus, Scotland, was drained in 1750 to enable peat
    and marl to be dug from the ground. This skull was dug from beneath 10 feet of
    peat in the summer of 1790. The skull was presented to the Literary and Antiquarian
    Society of Perth in 1791 by James Wright a Dundee merchant.
