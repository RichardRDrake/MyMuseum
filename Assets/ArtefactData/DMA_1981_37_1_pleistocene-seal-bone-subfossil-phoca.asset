  ArtefactContent: Found in the Errol Clay of the Carse of Gowrie, Perthshire, Scotland. 
    As the climate warmed at the end of the last ice age the glacier flowing into
    the sea in the Tay estuary retreated and clay, and drop stones from icebergs,
    were deposited. This is the Errol Clay which contains fossils, such as this seal
    bone, that are from animals found nowadays in high Arctic waters
